# Develop your Angular & Firebase apps fully locally with the Firebase Emulator

Welcome to my course!

In this course you'll learn how to confidently develop your Angular & Firebase Application locally, as a way to avoid
getting billed by a mistake like having a roge Cloud Function spam your database in an infinite loop.

## What is the Firebase Emulator?

The Firebase Local Emulator Suite is a set of advanced tools for developers looking to build and test apps locally using
Cloud Firestore, Cloud Storage, Authentication, Cloud Functions, Pub/Sub, and Firebase Hosting.

It provides a rich user interface to help you get running and prototyping quickly.

## What will you need to know before the course?

This isn't an Angular or Firebase course, so familiarity with both tools is required (_Or at least with Firebase, if
you're using a different UI framework most of the course will still apply_).

## What will you be learning?

You'll learn:

- How to set up the local emulator suite to develop your app locally.
- How to tell your app to use the emulator or the online version depending on the environment.
- How to pass seed data to the emaulator so that you can make it as similar to production as possible.
